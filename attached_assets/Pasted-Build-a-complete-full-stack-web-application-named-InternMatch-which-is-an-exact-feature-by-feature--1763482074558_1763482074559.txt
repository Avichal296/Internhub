Build a complete full-stack web application named InternMatch, which is an exact feature-by-feature, UI-by-UI clone of Internshala.com.

Use the following stack, even if it requires BEST_EFFORT_FALLBACK:

Next.js 14 (App Router + React Server Components)

Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI

Supabase (Database + Storage)

Firebase Authentication (Email/Password + OTP Email Verification)

TypeScript

I will manually provide:

Firebase API keys

Supabase URL + anon + service key

You must generate the entire codebase and the complete structure.

1. Core Requirement

Build InternMatch as a production-grade Internshala clone, including:

Student Features

Home page with search bar, filters, cards

Internship listing page with real-time filters (role, city, stipend range, duration, skills, WFH)

Internship detail page

Apply page with custom questions

Student dashboard:

Profile (education, skills, resume)

Applied internships

Saved internships

Notifications center

Recruiter Features

Recruiter signup/login (Firebase)

Company profile builder

Post internship job form

Manage posted internships

View applicants

Update application status

Admin Features

Admin login (Firebase auth + role check)

Approve/reject recruiters

Approve/reject internship postings

Remove fake or duplicate posts

View analytics dashboard

2. Database (Supabase)

Auto-generate SQL and create all tables:

users (linked to Firebase UID)
id uuid primary key
full_name text
email text
role text
phone text
bio text
education jsonb
skills text[]
resume_url text
created_at timestamp

companies
internships
applications
saved_internships
notifications

(RLS policies must also be generated.)

3. Firebase Authentication

Implement:

Email/password login

OTP email verification

Role-based access:

student

recruiter

admin

Use middleware to protect routes.

4. UI/UX

Recreate Internshala’s layout exactly, including:

Navigation bar

Filters sidebar

Internship cards

Dashboard sidebar

Clean typography

Mobile responsiveness

Use:

Tailwind

ShadCN components

5. Functional Requirements

Search engine using Supabase SQL filters

Sorting + pagination

Resume uploader (Supabase storage)

Apply form using server actions

Recruiter review panel

Admin approval system

Notification system

No fake data — everything must come from Supabase tables

6. Deliverables (Replit must generate)
Provide:

Full Next.js codebase

Complete folder structure

All React components

Supabase client configuration

Firebase auth integration

Server Actions for all CRUD operations

SQL schema + migrations

Middleware for route protection

Tailwind + ShadCN setup

Admin dashboard

Recruiter dashboard

Student dashboard

Deployment instructions

7. Final Required Behavior

Do NOT use any mock or placeholder data

Fetch everything from Supabase

Ensure clean modular code

Make the project ready for production

Implement all user roles

Copy Internshala’s UX flow exactly

Build the complete InternMatch platform exactly according to these specifications.
