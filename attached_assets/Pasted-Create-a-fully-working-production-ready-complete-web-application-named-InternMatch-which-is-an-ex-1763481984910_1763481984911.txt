Create a fully working, production-ready, complete web application named InternMatch, which is an exact functional and UI/UX clone of Internshala.com.
Build everything inside a single Replit project using the following stack:

Next.js 14 (app router)

Supabase (database + storage)

Firebase Authentication

Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI

TypeScript

No fake data — pull everything from Supabase tables

Auto-generate all Supabase tables and SQL

I will provide Firebase keys + Supabase URL + Supabase anon/service key.

1. Project Architecture (Mandatory)

Create the following folders:

/app
  /(public-pages)
  /(student)
  /(recruiter)
  /(admin)
/components
/lib
  supabase.ts
  firebase.ts
  auth.ts
  utils.ts
/styles
/schemas
/sql


Use React Server Components by default.

2. Firebase Auth Requirements

Implement:

Email/password signup & login

OTP email verification

Role-based routing

student

recruiter

admin

Firebase session persistence in Next.js via middleware

A hook: useFirebaseUser()

A server utility: getCurrentUser()

Store user roles inside Supabase (not Firebase).

3. Supabase (Database + Storage)

Replit should generate SQL and create tables automatically.

TABLES TO CREATE:
users
id (uuid, primary key, matches Firebase UID)
full_name text
email text
role text CHECK ('student' | 'recruiter' | 'admin')
phone text
bio text
education jsonb
skills text[]
resume_url text
created_at timestamptz default now()

companies
id bigint generated always as identity primary key
recruiter_id uuid references users(id)
company_name text
description text
website text
logo_url text
created_at timestamptz default now()

internships
id bigint generated always as identity primary key
company_id bigint references companies(id)
title text
category text
description text
responsibilities text
stipend_min integer
stipend_max integer
location text
is_wfh boolean
duration text
openings integer
perks text
skills_required text[]
status text CHECK ('pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected')
created_at timestamptz default now()

applications
id bigint generated always as identity primary key
internship_id bigint references internships(id)
user_id uuid references users(id)
answers jsonb
status text CHECK ('applied','selected','rejected')
applied_at timestamptz default now()

saved_internships
user_id uuid references users(id)
internship_id bigint references internships(id)
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, internship_id)

notifications
id bigint generated always as identity primary key
user_id uuid references users(id)
title text
message text
read boolean default false
created_at timestamptz default now()

4. Mandatory RLS Policies

Replit should generate RLS policies:

Student:

Can read all approved internships

Can view/edit only their own profile

Can apply only once per internship

Recruiter:

Can manage their own company postings

Can view applicants for their posts

Admin:

Full access

Can approve/reject internship posts and recruiters

5. UI/UX Requirements (Exact Clone of Internshala)

Recreate the entire Internshala website:

Public UI

Homepage with:

Search bar

Category filters

WFH toggle

Trending internships

Internship listing page

Internship detail page

Student Dashboard

Profile page (education, skills, resume upload)

Applied internships

Saved internships

Notification center

Recruiter Dashboard

Company profile builder

Post Internship form

Manage posted internships

Applicant viewer (with resume preview)

Admin Dashboard

Approve/reject:

recruiters

internships

System analytics

Flagged content reviewer

6. Functional Requirements
Search Engine (Supabase SQL)

Profile filter

Location filter

Stipend range

Duration

Start date

Skills

Sorting: newest, stipend high→low

Internship Details

Company info

Responsibilities

Stipend

Duration

Skills

Apply form (text questions)

Applications

Students can apply

Recruiters can review applicants

Status update (selected/rejected)

Resume Upload

Upload to Supabase Storage

Generate file URL

7. No Fake Data Rule

All pages must fetch ONLY real data from Supabase.

No placeholders, no mock JSON, no dummy content.

If a section has no data, display “No items found”.

8. Deliverables from Replit AI

Replit must generate:

1. Full Next.js codebase
2. All pages + components
3. All SQL migrations
4. Supabase client setup
5. Firebase auth integration
6. RLS policies
7. Tailwind + ShadCN setup
8. Full working student, recruiter, admin dashboards
9. API routes (server actions)
10. Deployment instructions
9. Build the Entire InternMatch Platform

Build the complete system according to the above specs.
This must be a production-grade Internshala clone with all real functionality.
